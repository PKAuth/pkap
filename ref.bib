abstract="Cryptographic hash functions are an important tool in cryptography for applications such as digital fingerprinting of messages, message authentication, and key derivation. During the last five years, several fast software hash functions have been proposed; most of them are based on the design principles of Ron Rivest's MD4. One such proposal was RIPEMD, which was developed in the framework of the EU project RIPE (Race Integrity Primitives Evaluation). Because of recent progress in the cryptanalysis of these hash functions, we propose a new version of RIPEMD with a 160-bit result, as well as a plug-in substitute for RIPEMD with a 128-bit result. We also compare the software performance of several MD4-based algorithms, which is of independent interest.",
